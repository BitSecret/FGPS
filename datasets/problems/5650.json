  "problem_text_en": "The Changqing District Government is preparing to build an overpass with a height of AB = N_0 in the University City. It is known that the angle between the slope AC of the overpass and the ground BC ∠ACB has a sine value of \\frac{N_1}{N_2}, so the length of the slope AC is ()",
