  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, to build a highway in a certain place, a tunnel must be built from B to C (B and C are on the same level). In order to measure the distance between B and C, an engineer took a hot air balloon to start from C and rose vertically N_0 to reach A. Observing the depression angle of B at A is N_1, then the distance between B and C is ()",
