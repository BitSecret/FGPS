  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, at N_0 in the morning, a boat starts from point A and sails northward at a speed of N_1 mile/hour, and arrives at point B at N_2. Looking at lighthouse C from A and B, it is measured that ∠NAC = N_3, ∠NBC = N_4 , Then the distance from point B to lighthouse C is ()",
