  "problem_text_en": "Fold down point A of the pentagonal paper ABCDE in Figure 1 with BE as the fold line, and point A just falls on the CD, as shown in Figure 2; then use AB and AE in Figure 2 as the fold lines, respectively. Fold the two points C and D upward so that the five points A, B, C, D, and E are all on the same plane, as shown in Figure 3. If ∠A = N_0 in Figure 1, then the degree of ∠CAD in Figure 3 is ()",
