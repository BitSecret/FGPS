  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, in order to measure the width of the river, Wang Fang measured the position of a tree P on the opposite bank at two points M and N apart from N_0 on the river bank. P is in the direction of north of M and the distance between them is N_1 , then the width of the river is ()",
