  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, it is the situation where two wooden boards A and B are placed on the ground. In the figure, ∠1 and ∠2 are the angles between the two boards A and B and the ground respectively, and ∠3 is the angle between the two boards. If ∠3 = N_0, then ∠2 - ∠1 = ()",
