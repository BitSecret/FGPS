  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, the tree AB is perpendicular to the ground to measure the height of the tree. Xiao Ming is at C and measured ∠ACB = N_0. He walked N_1 in the direction of CB and reached point D, and measured ∠ADB = N_2, then Xiao Ming calculated the tree The height is ()",
