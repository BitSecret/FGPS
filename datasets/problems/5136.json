  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, the two ships depart from point O at the same time, one travels in a straight line in the direction of N_0 to the north by west, and the other travels in a straight line in the direction of N_1 to the south by east. After N_2 hours, they reach points A and B respectively, then at this time, the degree of the angle of the travel route of the two ships ∠AOB is ()",
