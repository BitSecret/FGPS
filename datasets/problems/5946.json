  "problem_text_en": "After the Wenchuan earthquake, the rescue team sent a helicopter to the two villages of A and B. The aircraft was at point P above the ground N_0. The measured depression angle of village A was N_1 and the depression angle of village B was N_2 (as shown in the figure). Then the distance between the two villages A and B is ().",
