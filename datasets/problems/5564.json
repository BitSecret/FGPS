  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, it is known that there is a laser auxiliary signal within a certain range of the lighthouse M. A ship is sailing at a constant speed from south by north at a constant speed at sea. The ship measured at A and measured that the lighthouse M was in the direction N_0 to the east by north, and it traveled N_1. Arrived at point B after hours, and just entered the laser signal area of ​​lighthouse M at this time. It is measured that lighthouse M is in the direction of N_2 east by north, then the time for the ship to pass the laser signal area of ​​lighthouse M is ()",
