  "problem_text_en": "A submarine uses sonar to measure the linear distance between a stationary fishing boat on the water and it at N_0 under the water as N_1. If it heads towards the fishing boat (the depth remains the same), and it can be located directly below the fishing boat for N_2 seconds, the average speed of the submarine is ()",
