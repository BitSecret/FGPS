  "problem_text_en": "Some people say that a mathematician is someone who can know the height of a tree without climbing or cutting down the tree. Xiao Min wants to know the height of a big tree on the campus. As shown in the figure, she measured BC = N_0 and ∠ACB = N_1. Please help her calculate the height of the tree AB (). (Note: ①The tree is perpendicular to the ground; ②Data for selection: sinN_1 ≈N_2, cosN_1 ≈N_3, tanN_1 ≈N_4)",
