  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, at N_0 in the morning, a ship departs from point A and sails northward at a speed of N_1 nautical miles/hour, and arrives at point B at N_2 and N_3 minutes. From point A, lighthouse C is measured in the direction N_4 west by north. From point B, lighthouse C is measured in the N_5 direction west of north, then the distance from point B to lighthouse C is ()",
