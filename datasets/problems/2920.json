  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, the two vertices A and C to be measured are separated by the pond. Master Li chooses a point B outedge AC, connects BA and BC, and takes the midvertices E and F of BA and BC respectively, and then measures E and F. The distance between the two vertices is equal to N_0, then the distance between the two vertices A and C is ()",
