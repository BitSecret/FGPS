  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, it is known that a fisherman on a fishing boat sees lighthouse M in the direction N_0 east by north at point A. This fishing boat sails eastward at a speed of N_1 nautical miles/hour, and arrives at point B in half an hour, and sees it at point B The lighthouse M is in the N_2 direction to the east by north. At this time, the distance between the lighthouse M and the fishing boat is ()",
