  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, a teaching interest group wants to measure the height of a tree CD. They firstly measured the elevation angle of the tree top C at point A as N_0, and then proceeded N_1 along the direction of AD to point B, and the elevation angle of tree top C measured at B is N_2  (the three points A, B, and D are on the same straight line), then the height of the tree CD is ()",
