  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, in order to green the barren hills, a certain place plans to lay water pipes along the hillside from the machine well room located at the foot of the hill, and build a pumping station on the hillside to sprinkle and irrigate the green land on the slope. It is now measured that the degree of the angle between the slope and the horizontal plane is N_0. In order to make the height of the water outlet N_1, the length of the water pipe that needs to be prepared is ()",
