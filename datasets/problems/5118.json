  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the picture, Uncle Wu's house is an equilateral triangle open space ABC. It is known that the points E and F are the midpoints of sides AB and AC respectively, and the measurement is EF = N_0. He wants to surround the quadrilateral BCFE with a fence for stocking For chicks, the length of the fence is ()",
