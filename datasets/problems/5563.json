At point B, it is measured that the island A is in the direction of N_0 to the east and sailing N_1 nautical miles to reach point D. This is It is measured that the small island A is in the direction N_2 east by north. If the fishing boat does not change its course and continues to sail east without the danger of hitting the rocks, the maximum value of a is ()",
