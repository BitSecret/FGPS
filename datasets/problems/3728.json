  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, in a practical activity class, in order to measure the distance between the two points of pond B and C, Xiaoming first selected a point A on one side of the pond, and then measured the midpoints D, E, and DE of AB and AC. = N_0, so the distance between the two points of pond B and C can be calculated as ()",
