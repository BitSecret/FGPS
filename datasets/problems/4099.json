  "problem_text_en": "One day, my father took Xiao Ming to a construction site and saw a herringbone as shown in the picture. Dad said, \"Xiao Ming, I will test you. The angle of this herringbone ∠1 is equal to N_0, you know that ∠3 is better than ∠ 2 How old is it?\" Xiao Ming got the correct answer immediately, his answer was ()",
