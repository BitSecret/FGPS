  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, the height of the floor of a truck compartment from the ground is \\frac{N_0}{N_1}. In order to facilitate the loading, a wooden board is often used to form an inclined plane. If the angle between the inclined plane and the horizontal ground is not greater than N_2, the length of this wooden board is at least ( )",
