  "problem_text_en": "In order to facilitate travel, more and more Chongqing citizens have used shared bicycles in recent days. Figure 1 is a physical diagram of a bicycle, Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of a bicycle, AB is parallel to the ground, points A, B, and D are in line, and points D, F , G collinear, cushion C can be adjusted along the beam BE direction. It is known that ∠ABE = N_0, ∠EAB = N_1, the wheel radius is N_2, BE = N_3. After the experience, Xiao Ming feels that it is more comfortable to ride when the seat cushion C is N_4 above the ground. At this time, the length of CE is about () (the result is accurate to N_5, reference data: sin70 ≈N_7, cos70 ≈N_9, tan70 ≈N_11)",
