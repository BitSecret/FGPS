  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, planting trees on a hillside requires that the plant spacing (the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees) AC is N_0, and the measured slope angle is N_1, then the slope distance AB between two adjacent trees on the slope is approximately ( ) (Keep one decimal place, N_2 ≈N_3)",
