  "problem_text_en": "As shown in the figure, after a car has turned twice through a section of road, it is the same as the original driving direction, that is, the two roads before and after turning are parallel to each other. The first turning angle ∠B is equal to N_0, and the degree of angle the second turning ∠C is ()",
