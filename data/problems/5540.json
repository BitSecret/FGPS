As shown in the figure, the shaded part is the green land, with A, B, C, and D as the center and four radii of N_1. The radii of the four sectors with A, B, C, D as the center and radii of N_1 are equal to the diameter of ⊙O in the figure , and AB = N_2 has been measured, then the area of ​​the green land is ()^2.",
