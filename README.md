## Brief Introduction

Formal mathematics plays an important role in mathematical research, especially with the deepening of mathematical
research, the theory becomes obscure and difficult to understand, and computer aided verification is more needed.
Geometry involves the literal description and image representation of knowledge, the unity of algebraic calculation and
symbolic reasoning, so it is difficult to formalize.  
In addition, with the development of artificial intelligence, AI-assisted mathematics research has become a promising
research direction. For the answers to the mathematical problems generated by AI, it is also necessary to design a
reasoning machine for automatic verification.  
So we designed a plane geometry formalization system and provided a python implementation of this system, which we call
FormalGeo. It can accept formalized problem description, infer the goal and output the problem-solving process.

**FormalGeo** is an extended version of **[GeoMechanical](https://github.com/BitSecret/GeoMechanical)**. It supports
solving more types of plane geometric problems.
